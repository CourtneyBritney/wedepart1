# BCook — Cooking & Culinary Hub Website

## 📖 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **WEDE5020wPOE** module.  
The website represents a fictional culinary brand called **BCook**, designed to showcase cooking classes, recipes, and services.  

The aim of the project is to:
- Build a functional, multi-page website using **HTML only** (no CSS/JS yet).  
- Create structured and standards-compliant HTML code.  
- Develop navigation across pages.  
- Include functional forms (waiting list and contact enquiry).  
- Prepare a foundation for future styling and functionality.

PART 2:


This update completes Part 2 of the project, adding styling and responsiveness to the HTML pages created in Part 1.

✅ What Was Done

External CSS:

Created a single css/style.css file for all pages.

Linked it in each HTML file to keep styles centralized and maintainable.

Base Styles & Theme:

Added a light background, warm accent color (#e67e22), and clean, modern typography.

Applied consistent padding, margins, and box-shadows to create a polished look.

Layout & Structure:

Used CSS Grid for gallery and services layouts and Flexbox for navigation and call-to-action rows.

Added a sticky header for better usability.

Typography & Visuals:

Styled headings (h1, h2, h3) with consistent font sizes and spacing.

Added hover, focus, and active states for links and buttons.

Responsive Design:

Implemented breakpoints at 1024px and 680px for tablets and mobiles.

Gallery and service sections reflow from 3 columns → 2 → 1.

Hero section collapses into a single column on small screens.

Navigation remains usable and visually consistent across screen sizes.

Gallery Fix:

Ensured all gallery images have the same size using object-fit: cover and a fixed height, giving a uniform look.

Assets:

Added placeholder hero images (hero-800.png, hero-1200.png, hero-1600.png) and six dish images for the gallery.

README & Documentation:

Added this section to document Part 2 progress.

Updated file structure to include /css, /html, and /img folders for better organization.
